Getting and Cleaning Data. Assignment 1

run_analysis.R is the R script for the first assignment. It loads the data from my working directory and merges the training and test data sets.
This script also involves re naming a few columns. 
After the train and test files are merged, for each subject and for each label average values of 66 variables are calculated.
