All the variable description is given in the features_info.txt file
The 1st variable is the "subject" - the 30 people who do the experiment
The 2nd variable is the "predictor" or the "ctivity label" - Walking, Sitting etc. 

In the code, the object data is the merged data set of train and test.
data.extract contains the selected columns of mean and std
data.extract2 contains the data.extract and subject and predictor(labels) 
tidy.dataset is the final data set which is also uploaded.
